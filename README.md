Boarding
========

This software is intended to be a web app for scheduling boarding. It is meant to both demonstrate the use of Elm and actually be used in production alongside practice management software.

As of now, it is merely demonstrating the ability to draw a grid where the day of the month goes on top and the number of occupied runs is shown below so that you can see an overview of occupancy. This is different from a lot of boarding management systems that require you to assign runs to pets. That is somewhat nonsensical when the runs are not customized because it is more than likely that pets will change from dirty to clean runs.
